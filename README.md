# feature-flag-poc
Just some skeleton code for how one might/could implement a rougg library for storing and retrieving the value of feature-flags.

TODO:
- There is no logic for how to read and store data in the database
- The path to the properties-file need to be fixed
- There is no Dependency Injection defined, meaning that it right now is just dangling code
- There is no logic for communicating with what could/should be server-code from what would be a/the client implementation
- There is no GUI written for updating and rendering the values of the different properties
